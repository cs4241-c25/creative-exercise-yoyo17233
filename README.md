# Tim Kwartler Simple SVG Animation
- Hosted on http://creative-exercise-yoyo17233.glitch.me
- I chose to do SVG. The example I based it off was the very first example on this page, with a changing radius, -https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_scripting.asp.
- The main changes I made, was instead of having the button change the radius once, I had it begin a loop, changing the radius from 1 to 200, scaling rate-of-change by the radius, so a larger circle would grow/shrink faster than a smaller circle. Additionally, I changed the viewport in order to make the circle become larger than the original circle.
